at top level there are scripts that 
dont really belong to a group of scripts

1. cell
	scripts related to cells
2. grid
	scripts related to the grid
3. UI
	scripts related to ui
4. Scripts related to units

right now, in unit, grid, and cell, 
i am following a convention with my scripts

////////////
X [folder]
--editor [folder]
		---HorizonXEditor 
		(a custom inspector for a component) 
		(does not effect runtime)
--HorizonXModel 
(game logic. should not contain visual information.) 
(should only talk to other models.)
--HorizonXGameView 
(how the object looks during play. Depends on its model.) 
(should only talk to its own model. should not talk to other views)
--HorizonXSceneView 
(how the object is presented in the scene view [gizmos/highlighting, etc]) 
(does not effect runtime)

-- hmm i might not be following my own rules in places

-- also, this file is probably going to be outdated mosat of the time, 
because scripts in such change rapedly

-- the diferance between a gaveview class and a ui related class, is that ui classes manipulate unity UI objects
gameview objects mostly manipulate regular gameobjects etc

--hmm ... we will probably to make the ui code make more sence at some point
